# RULES
#    Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
#    Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
#    Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
#    Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

# FEATURES

# User input to create seed cells
# Have a list of standard initial cell positions
# Aility to change the rules either initially by design or later by algorithm

# Initialize Variables
# use appropriate graphics library

# To Do
# Representation of cells
# c1, x_pos, y_pos
# c2, x_pos, y_pos
# cells come and go, time accumulates
# cn, x_pos, y_pos


# Iterate through simulation
# Check environment around cell
# compare Cx, x_pos, y_pos with adjacent 8 cell positions. count and add, if <2 then die, #if more than 3 then also die. 
# there is something missing here about the potential of a future adjacent cell


# Spawn child or die at appropriate position
